# What’s new in Mopidy 3.0?

The most significant change in Mopidy 3.0 is adding support for Python 3.7+ and
dropping support for Python 2.x. Other release highlights include:

- Moving the MPD frontend and Local backend out of Mopidy Core and into their own projects.

- The new [extension registry](https://mopidy.com/ext/).

- A configurable default web app for the HTTP frontend.

- Simplified logging configuration.

- Improvements to Mopidy’s Core API including removal of many long-deprecated APIs.

For a comprehensive list of changes please see the [changelog](https://docs.mopidy.com/en/latest/changelog/).

Mopidy 3 also brings new versions of all extensions, some of which include new
features. Most noticeably,
[Mopidy-Spotify 4](https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy-spotify/blob/master/CHANGELOG.rst#v400-2019-12-22)
supports (read-only) playlists again, and also offers additional browse sections.

# Should I upgrade yet?

Yes! The Debian packages for Mopidy and those extensions maintained under the
[Mopidy GitHub organisation](https://github.com/mopidy/) should now be
available from [apt.mopidy.com](https://apt.mopidy.com/) for all supported
architectures.

Likewise, packages for
[Arch Linux](https://docs.mopidy.com/en/latest/installation/arch/#arch-install)
and everything required to [install from
source](https://docs.mopidy.com/en/latest/installation/pypi/) is ready.

# How do I upgrade to Mopidy 3?

This depends on how you installed Mopidy 2.x.
See our [documentation](https://docs.mopidy.com/en/latest/installation/).

# Why did you drop support for Python 2?

[Python 2 will not be maintained after January 1,
2020](https://pythonclock.org/) and there is no future for Python projects that
are not compatible with Python 3. Python 2 and Python 3 are similar but do have
significant differences and so there’s considerable burden in also supporting
Python 2. If you are limited to Python 2 then stay with [Mopidy
v2.3.1](https://docs.mopidy.com/en/release-2.3/changelog/).

# There are numerous versions of Python 3, which one do I need?

The minimum supported version is Python 3.7 but we also support newer versions
such as Python 3.8. Python 3.7 was primarily chosen as it, at the time of
porting, is the version of Python shipped in Debian stable (Buster). Python
3.7, or newer, is also available by default in Ubuntu 18.10, Arch Linux,
Fedora 29, and in macOS via Homebrew. You can see what the default version of
Python 3 is on your system by running `python3 --version`.

# What about Mopidy 3 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS?

Ubuntu 18.04 (Bionic Beaver) is [nearly 2 years
old](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/BionicBeaver) and [Long Term
Support](https://wiki.ubuntu.com/LTS) releases are enterprise focused with
stability in mind; they are _not_ designed for running cutting-edge software,
such as Mopidy 3. The next Ubuntu LTS release is 20.04 (Focal Fossa) and
scheduled for April 2020. It will ship with Python 3.8 and so Mopidy will work
out of the box with that. If you are stuck using Ubuntu 18.04 then you'll find
it uses Python 3.6 by default. Getting Mopidy 3 running is possible, but
requires some work. One such way is detailed below.

Alternatively, you can continue using Mopidy v2.3.1 until Ubuntu 20.04 is
released - just be sure to use Mopidy’s [2.x
documentation](https://docs.mopidy.com/en/release-2.3/) and only install old
Python 2 versions of any extensions from
[PyPI](https://pypi.org/search/?q=mopidy).

A Docker based installation of Mopidy 3 on Ubuntu 18.04 should also be possible.

# So how do I install Mopidy 3 on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS?

Newer versions of Python are available from Ubuntu’s software repositories and
installing Python 3.7 is as easy as running:

```
sudo apt install -y python3.7
```

Next, follow the first **three** steps of the instructions for [installing from
source](https://docs.mopidy.com/en/latest/installation/pypi/). Then install
Mopidy _under Python 3.7_ with:

```
sudo python3.7 -m pip install --ignore-installed mopidy
```

The GStreamer side of things is a little trickier. We need versions
of `python3-gi` and `python3-gst-1.0` that are compatible with Python 3.7 but
the versions available in Ubuntu 18.04
([-gi](https://packages.ubuntu.com/bionic/python3-gi),
[-gst-1.0](https://packages.ubuntu.com/bionic/python3-gst-1.0)) only support the
system Python version.

First up is pygobject: the Python 3 bindings for gobject-introspection
(`python3-gi`). This is easy to build from source using `pip`, once the
required dependencies have been installed:

```
sudo apt install -y \
    libcairo2-dev \
    libffi-dev \
    libgirepository1.0-dev \
    libglib2.0-dev \
    python3.7-dev

sudo python3.7 -m pip install --ignore-installed --no-cache pygobject
```

The GStreamer Python binding overrides (`python3-gst-1.0`) are not so simple as
they are [not available from
PyPI](https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-python/issues/25). The
easiest way is to get 3.7 compatible files from an alternate version of
`python3-gst-1.0`, and copy them into the Python 3.7 installation:

```
wget http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/universe/g/gst-python1.0/python3-gst-1.0_1.14.4-1_amd64.deb
ar x python3-gst-1.0_1.14.4-1_amd64.deb
tar -pxvf data.tar.xz
sudo mv usr/lib/python3/dist-packages/gi/overrides/* /usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/gi/overrides/
```

If you want to [run Mopidy in a
terminal](https://docs.mopidy.com/en/latest/running/terminal/) then you are
all done and `python3.7 -m mopidy` should now work. But if you want to [run
Mopidy as a service](https://docs.mopidy.com/en/latest/running/service/) then
there are a few more steps and things get a little messier.

Download the latest Debian package for Mopidy 3 (as of writing this is
v3.0.2 but adjust as required):

```
wget https://apt.mopidy.com/pool/main/m/mopidy/mopidy_3.0.2-1_all.deb
```

Find any missing dependencies by attempting to install; this will likely fail:

```
sudo dpkg -i mopidy_3.0.2-1_all.deb
```

Install those missing dependencies and then install again; this should succeed:

```
sudo apt install --fix-broken
sudo dpkg -i mopidy_3.0.2-1_all.deb
```

Force the Mopidy service to use our Python 3.7 installation:

```
sudo sed -i 's/python3/python3.7/' /usr/bin/mopidy
```

Finally, remove packages we no longer need, including those left over from
Mopidy 2.x:

```
sudo apt autoremove \
    libcairo2-dev \
    libffi-dev \
    libgirepository1.0-dev \
    libglib2.0-dev
```

Be sure to install all Mopidy extensions from source using
`sudo python3.7 -m pip install mopidy-foo-extension`.

# What about Mopidy 3 on Debian Stretch?

Debian Stretch (oldstable) is not supported. Mopidy 3 requires
GStreamer >= v1.14.0 but [Stretch provides
v1.10.x](https://packages.debian.org/stretch/libgstreamer1.0-0). There are
[great new features in v1.14](https://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/releases/1.14)
and now we get to finally start using them.

# What happened to the MPD frontend and the Local backend?

The [Mopidy-MPD](https://mopidy.com/ext/mpd) and
[Mopidy-Local](https://mopidy.com/ext/local) extensions are no longer bundled
with Mopidy and have been moved to independent extension. We hope this will
help ease development and encourage contributions. After the move, Mopidy-Local
merged with Mopidy-Local-SQLite and Mopidy-Local-Images; the functionality of
these three projects is now available under one roof in Mopidy-Local. If you
used either of these extensions you will now need to explicitly install them.

To install Mopidy-MPD: `sudo python3 -m pip install mopidy-mpd`

To install Mopidy-Local: `sudo python3 -m pip install mopidy-local`.

The configuration for Mopidy-Local has changed and you may need to merge/move
your previous settings. Refer to [Mopidy-Local's
documentation](https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy-local#configuration) for the
available config values.

# Why doesn’t Mopidy extension X work?

Some Mopidy extensions do not support Mopidy 3 yet. You can find information on
which ones do at our [extension registry](https://mopidy.com/ext/). Any Python
3 compatible extensions installed using your package manager should be updated
when you upgrade Mopidy. But any extensions that were installed from PyPI will
need to be explicitly re-installed for Python 3
e.g. `sudo python3 -m pip install Mopidy-dLeyna`.

# When will Mopidy extension X support Mopidy 3?

Extensions maintained under the [Mopidy GitHub
organisation](https://github.com/mopidy/) have been ported to Python 3 and
support Mopidy 3.0. For those commmunity maintained extensions not yet ported to
Python 3, visit the project’s GitHub page for more info and also consider
lending the maintainer a helping hand. Please be patient during this
transitional period.

# Do I need to remove anything from Mopidy 2?

If [installed from source or
PyPI](https://docs.mopidy.com/en/latest/installation/pypi/) you may want to
remove Mopidy 2 from your system, but it’s not strictly necessary. Mopidy on
Python 3 won’t in any way be affected by any remnants of Mopidy on Python 2.

Mopidy installed using your system package manager (e.g. apt) will
automatically remove the old Python 2 version of Mopidy as part of the upgrade.

# What about these service configuration changes?

When updating the Debian package you will probably get the following:

```
Configuration file '/etc/mopidy/mopidy.conf'
 ==> Modified (by you or by a script) since installation.
 ==> Package distributor has shipped an updated version.
   What would you like to do about it ?  Your options are:
    Y or I  : install the package maintainer's version
    N or O  : keep your currently-installed version
      D     : show the differences between the versions
      Z     : start a shell to examine the situation
 The default action is to keep your current version.
*** mopidy.conf (Y/I/N/O/D/Z) [default=N] ? 
```

If you enter `D` here it will display the differences. You'll see the default
service-specific `[core]` and `[logging]` configuration has been removed (it
now lives elsewhere). The remaining differences will be anything you added
yourself e.g. account details for extensions, the path to your music files, a
custom audio output etc. You'll probably still need all of that. The main
exception is any configuration for [Mopidy-Local](https://mopidy.com/ext/local/)
as some things changed following the move, please check the project's
[documentation](https://github.com/mopidy/mopidy-local#configuration) for
details.

If you are not sure what to do, select option `Y` and get the new default
Mopidy 3 service configuration. You will still find your old configuration at
`/etc/mopidy/mopidy.conf.dpkg-old`, which you can compare against the output of
`sudo mopidyctl config` to see what configuration you actually still need to
specify in `/etc/mopidy/mopidy.conf` to obtain the setup you want. Afterwards,
feel free to delete `mopidy.conf.dpkg-old`.
