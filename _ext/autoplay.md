Mopidy extension to automatically pick up where you left off and start playing
the last track from the position before Mopidy was shut down. It also restores
the tracklist options "Consume", "Random", "Repeat" and "Single". It also
remembers the volume and if Mopidy was muted.

The exact behaviour is configurable, e.g. it is possible to force Mopidy to
play a certain track or to start always unmuted.
